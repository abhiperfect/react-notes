# React JS notes
This repo contains reactJS notes I took while learning. It may include content from different courses and materials available for free on web :)

### NOTE:
- All these notes in markdown format, so opening [Index](React%20Basics/0%20Index.md) file there will help a lot.
- These notes are made in [obsidian](obsidian.md) app, use this to get distraction free learning experience. 
- To get most out of it, you can use a theme I designed for obsidian keeping in mind ease of learning to code. Find it here: `coming soon`
  
Thanks! :)
